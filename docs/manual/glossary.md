| Term                     | Definition                                                                                                                        |

| **Indra Index**          | Composite metric combining rim energy, coherence, and symmetry balance. Closer to 1 indicates a visually rich yet stable frame.   |
| **Kuramoto field**       | The complex order parameter (Ottâ€“Antonsen reduction) evolved over the image grid, providing phase, coherence, and vorticity cues. |
| **Rim**                  | The chromatic edge halo generated by sampling along the edge normal with dispersion and crystalline comb filters.                 |
| **Surface warp**         | Wallpaper-driven offset applied to the base image, optionally constrained by wallpaper groups or hyperbolic curvature.            |
| **SU(7) projector**      | Colour-space projector that maps the seven-dimensional gauge representation back to RGB using configurable gates.                 |
| **Small-world rewiring** | Optional Kuramoto topology tweak that introduces long-range connections with probability `p_sw` to simulate cortical shortcuts.   |
| **Flux overlay**         | Optional vector field injected from the QCD module, used to bias rim hue/energy. Only available when volume modules are active.   |
| **Telemetry stream**     | WebSocket feed carrying frame-by-frame metrics (edge counts, phase stats, performance samples) for observability and logging.     |
| **Composer**             | Final blending stage that mixes rim, surface, Kuramoto, and volume contributions using exposure/gamma controls.                   |
